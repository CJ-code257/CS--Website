            <p>EqualEd: Education Unlocked was created in 2020 by committed teachers and community organizers who saw firsthand the heartbreaking consequences of inequity in education in the time of COVID-19. What began as a ground-up, volunteer-led initiative in Davao City bridging gaps for challenged students to reach online learning became a nationwide movement committed to tearing down walls to quality education. Our co-founders, who themselves comprised a team of ex-teachers, social workers, and technologists, shared one vision: every Filipino child, wherever they are from and whatever their socioeconomic background is, deserves good education.</p>
            <p>Today, EqualEd operates across multiple provinces in the Philippines, running mobile learning centers, digital literacy programs, and community education initiatives. We believe that education is not just about academic achievementâ€”it's about empowering individuals to transform their communities and create a more equitable society. Our holistic approach combines traditional teaching methods with innovative technology solutions, ensuring that we meet learners where they are and provide support that fits their unique circumstances and needs.</p>

            <h3>Christoff John D. Reonal</h3>
            <p><strong>Founder & Executive Director</strong></p>
            
            <p>Christoff is a firm believer in educational parity who knows firsthand the disadvantages that limited learning materials bring. Growing up and schooling in Davao, he saw firsthand how economic status and place can really affect a child's capacity to receive quality education. With a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, Christoff chose that he would spend his career applying technology in the service of a larger good. His web development experience and extensive presence in the Philippine education system most qualify him to head EqualEd's work of extending quality education to all Filipino children, especially those in marginalized sectors.</p>
