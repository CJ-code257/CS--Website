        <!-- Background of the Problem -->
        <section>
            <h2>The Global Education Crisis</h2>
            <p>Access to quality education is still one of the largest problems worldwide. UNESCO (2023) reports that more than 244 million children and young people are not in school worldwide, where the majority reside in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. Poverty, improved health, and sustainable development directly correlate with quality education. Without suitable educations, millions of young minds cannot achieve their full potential, creating cycles of inequality and stifling economic growth within their communities.</p>
            
            <p>Education inequality is also a cause for concern in the Philippines. A World Bank report (2021) noted that 9 out of 10 Filipino children at the age of 10 could not read or understand basic text. The learning inequality was reinforced by the COVID-19 pandemic, with great losses in literacy and numeracy cited by the Department of Education (DepEd, 2022). There remains a shortage of internet connectivity and learning materials in distant and poor areas that continues to hinder learning for students.</p>

            <h2>What's Being Done About It</h2>
            <img src="tablets.jpg" alt="Students using tablets in classroom" width="500" height="300">
            
            <p>The Philippine government and non-governmental organizations have instituted various programs to provide equal education. The K-12 program was embraced to improve the quality of the curriculum and prepare students for college and the workforce (DepEd, 2016). In 2018, the Alternative Learning System (ALS) was increased to provide out-of-school youth and adults with basic education equivalency opportunities (DepEd, 2019).</p>

            <p>Apart from this, other entities such as Teach for the Philippines and Save the Children continue to provide learning materials, teacher training, and advocacy for inclusive learning processes. In 2022, it also opened its Digital Rise Program to advocate digital literacy through channels of free online learning materials and the distribution of technology to learners and teachers.</p>

            <p>EqualEd bridges the gap between existing government programs and grassroots communities by establishing mobile learning centers and digital literacy hubs in underserved areas. We work directly with local communities to identify specific educational needs and provide targeted support through volunteer teachers, technology resources, and community engagement programs that complement existing government initiatives while ensuring no child is left behind.</p>
